abstract = {With the growth in sports betting, it is possible to bet, both before and during a match, on a range of outcomes in tennis. This paper shows how the standard statistics published by the ATP can be combined to predict the serving statistics to be obtained when two given players meet. These statistics are then used in a spreadsheet model to predict further match outcomes, such as the length of the match and chance of either player winning. These calculations can be updated as the match progresses. The method is demonstrated by focusing on a very long mens singles match between Roddick and El Aynaoui played at the 2003 Australian Open.},

abstract = {A well-established assumption in tennis is that point outcomes on each player’s serve in a match are independent and identically distributed (iid). With this assumption, it is enough to specify the serve probabilities for both players to derive a wide variety of event distributions, such as the expected winner and number of sets, and number of games. However, models using this assumption, which we will refer to as “point-based”, have typically performed worse than other models in the literature at predicting the match winner. This paper presents a point-based Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting the outcome of tennis matches. The model predicts the probability of winning a point on serve given surface, tournament and match date. Each player is given a serve and return skill which is assumed to follow a Gaussian random walk over time. In addition, each player’s skill varies by surface, and tournaments are given tournament-specific intercepts. When evaluated on the ATP’s 2014 season, the model outperforms other point-based models, predicting match outcomes with greater accuracy },

abstract = {<p>Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can also be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.</p>},
