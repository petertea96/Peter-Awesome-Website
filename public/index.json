Since 1989, the All-NBA award has been consistently partitioned into 3 tiers; 1st, 2nd and 3rd All-NBA teams where each team is uniquely composed of 2 guards, 2 forwards and 1 center.\nThe NBA holds a firm reputation of being a Star-Driven League, meaning that teams who boast the top players on their active rosters are the ones who can legitimately and exclusively contend for championships. The identification of All-NBA caliber players provides an interesting avenue where we can explore which players can serve as foundational pieces, and that may eventually land a fortunate team an elusive championship.\nWhile NBA pundits are accustomed to making predictions based on preconceived biases and opinions on players, we make our own All-NBA predictions using a set of classification models which hopefully reduces the emotional elements and recall biases plaguing NBA voting.\nIn this project, we fit several classification models on per 100 possessions data to vote in this year’s All-NBA selection. Then, we aggregate the results from each model that mimics the current All-NBA voting system.\n\n Obtaining/Scraping NBA Data  Box-score metrics standardized by per 100 possessions was obtained through R, using the bballR R package. We chose to look at per 100 possessions instead of the conventional per game standard since per 100 possessions provides a more intuitive comparison between players under different eras and team offence styles.\nPast All-NBA winners dating back from 1989 onward to 2019 was scraped through Basketball Reference with the rVest R package.\nTo further reduce noise in the data, we chose to only consider players meeting the following 2 conditions:\nPlayer participated in at least 10 games Player played at least 25 minutes/game  These conditions remove players who are not full-time NBA players and is aimed at choosing a representative sample of NBA players who are more inclined to be considered for the All-NBA teams.\nData Inconsistencies Many issues were faced when collecting data from different sources. One main concern was that player position data were inconsistent. For example in the 2017-18 season Anthony Davis was coded as a Forward, despite winning All-NBA award that year as a Center. Similarly in that same year, both Jimmy Butler and Lamarcus Aldridge were coded as a Guard and Center respectively, despite both being named onto the All-NBA as Forwards. Manual adjustments on player positions were made to adher to the position coded in the All-NBA data but since not all players are in the All-NBA data, it is very likely that other position inconsistencies were left untreated in the data.\n\n  Model Votes  In total, 6 models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), K-Nearest-Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost were fitted onto our data. Each model provided a probability estimate for each player being named to a 2020 All-NBA team, which we then ranked from greatest to least by position. We then mimic the current voting rules where for each voter, the top 2 ranked guards, top 2 forwards and top centre are awarded 3 voting points. The subsequent top 2 ranked guards, 2 forwards and center are awarded 2 voting points and the next sequence are awarded 1 voting point. We then add an extra sequence of players, which were awarded 0.5 voting points.\nThe prediction results are as follows:\nPredicted 2020 All-NBA 1st Team   Player Position Votes    Luka Dončić Guard 18  James Harden Guard 18  Giannis Antetokounmpo Forward 18  LeBron James Forward 17  Anthony Davis Center 18     Predicted 2020 All-NBA 2nd Team   Player Position Votes    Russell Westbrook Guard 10  Damian Lillard Guard 9.5  Kawhi Leonard Forward 13  Jimmy Butler Forward 7  Nikola Jokić Center 9     Predicted 2020 All-NBA 3rd Team   Player Position Votes    Trae Young Guard 5.5  Donovan Mitchell Guard 4  Khris Middleton Forward 6.5  Jayson Tatum Forward 5  Rudy Gobert Center 8.5     Honourable mentions Guards: Bradley Beal (3.5 votes), Kemba Walker (3 votes), Kyle Lowry (2 votes)\nForwards: Bam Adebayo (4 votes), Pascal Siakam (3 votes), Paul George (2 votes)\nCenter: Joel Embiid (3.5 votes)\n\n Model Comparisons To ensure fair and consistent comparison, we fit each model using the same training set and evaluate performance using the same test set. Since there was a huge imbalance in the number of All-NBA players vs. the number of Non-All-NBA players, we chose to obtain the train-test split with identical proportion of All-NBA cases. Here is the breakdown of our training and test data:\n    Data # 1st All NBA Team Players # 2nd All NBA Team Players # 3rd All NBA Team Players # Non-All-NBA Players    Training Data 116 116 116 3625  Test Data 39 39 39 1088  Total 155 155 155 4713    Both the training and test sets are composed of roughly 90% Non-All-NBA players, and 3.3% each of 1st, 2nd and 3rd All-NBA players. In total, the training set contained 348 All-NBA player observations (116 x 3 = 348), while the test set contained 117 All-NBA player observations (39 x 3 = 117).\nWe evaluate the performances of each model on the test set with the following metrics:\nHow well the model identifies players who ultimately end up on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd All-NBA teams. We define ith Team Sensitivity as:   ith Team Sensitivity = # True Positives on ith All-NBA team / Total number players on the ith All-NBA team where i = 1, 2, 3. Overall All-NBA sensitivity   Overall Sensitivity = # True Positives on any All-NBA team / Total number players on any All-NBA team How well the model properly identifies Non-All-NBA players. We define the False Positive Rate (FPR) as   FPR = # False Positive All-NBA players / Total number Non-All-NBA players  Note: True Positives represent the number of correctly predicted All-NBA players, while False Positives represent the number of incorrectly predicted All-NBA players. Ideally, we want models to have high sensitivity and low FPR. 1st Team All-NBA players should in theory be the easiest for the models to identify, since these players represent the supposed elite top 5 players after a given season. On the other hand, players who ultimately end up on the 2nd and 3rd All-NBA teams might be tougher for the models to identify; usually there is less consensus among voters on players occupying the secondary and tertiary teams.\nBelow, we present a table comparing our 5 models based on the metrics described above. \n   Performance Metric Logistic Regression Random Forest GAM KNN SVM XGBoost    1 1st All-NBA Sensitivity 0.92 0.87 0.97 0.85 0.90 0.87  2 2nd All-NBA Sensitivity 0.72 0.69 0.82 0.54 0.80 0.74  3 3rd All-NBA Sensitivity 0.51 0.41 0.59 0.31 0.54 0.46  4 Overall All-NBA Sensitivity 0.72 0.66 0.80 0.56 0.74 0.69  41 FPR 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02             How do we interpret these results? Let’s consider the logistic regression performance row. We see that this model was able to correctly identify 92.3 % of 1st team All-NBA players in the test set. That’s 36 out of 39 1st team players identified, which also means that this model was unable to identify three 1st All-NBA players (fyi these 3 players were: Guard Latrell Sprewell in 1994, Guard Jason Kidd in 1999 and Center Marc Gasol in 2015). Furthermore, the model was able to correctly identify 71.8 % of 2nd team All-NBA players (28 of 39) and 51.3% of 3rd team All-NBA players (20 of 39). In general, we see that all models have an easier time predicting players on the 1st team All-NBA compared to the remaining 2 All-NBA teams. Intuitively this means that the model is easily able to identify the greatest players (ranked 1 – 5) but struggles in identifying the last selections (ranked 11 – 15). We also generally see a tradeoff between a model’s sensitivity and their FPR. Take for example GAM which has the highest sensitivities across all 3 All-NBA teams, but also the highest FPR when compared against its competing models. The GAM model makes a higher volume of All-NBA predictions than its competitors, which leads to both a higher volume of True Positives (identifiying true All-NBA players) and False Negatives (misidentifying All-NBA players).\n\n  Logistic Regression  Logistic regression was the first classification algorithm fitted to our All-NBA data. Players with a predicted probability of making the All-NBA greater than 50% were classified as All-NBA predictions in the traning and test stages.\nLogistic Regression 2020 Predictions Here, we present the model’s All-NBA probability predictions on the 2020 season.\n Table 1: Logistic Regression 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 96.1 Anthony Davis  Center 58.4 Nikola Jokić  Center 49.2 Rudy Gobert  Center 36.4 Joel Embiid  Center 27.6 Karl-Anthony Towns  Forward 100.0 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 99.6 LeBron James  Forward 82.6 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 37.4 Jimmy Butler  Forward 33.3 Khris Middleton  Forward 9.7 Bam Adebayo  Forward 8.0 Zion Williamson  Forward 7.0 Jayson Tatum  Guard 98.3 James Harden  Guard 97.9 Luka Dončić  Guard 71.0 Damian Lillard  Guard 43.0 Kyrie Irving  Guard 38.6 Trae Young  Guard 27.9 Russell Westbrook  Guard 14.7 Ben Simmons  Guard 13.1 Chris Paul      Random Forest Classifier  A Random forest algorithm was the second classification algorithm fitted to our All-NBA data. The formation of nodes was made based on a gini index criterion (i.e. splitting nodes based on minimizing gini impurity). Other criterion, like entropy, was considered however was found to have comparable performance in terms of precision. The binary classification of All-NBA selection vs. Non-All-NBA selection was made with a threshold of 50% of votes from the aggregate decision trees. Other threshold values were considered, however was found to have lower precision. In total, we set 200 decision trees for the random forest.\nRandom Forest 2020 Predictions The probability estimates obtained represent the proportion among the 200 decision trees that predict an All-NBA selection.\n Table 2: Random Forest 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 84.0 Anthony Davis  Center 53.0 Rudy Gobert  Center 42.5 Nikola Jokić  Center 33.5 Joel Embiid  Center 31.5 Montrezl Harrell  Forward 85.0 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 76.0 LeBron James  Forward 68.0 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 33.5 Khris Middleton  Forward 29.0 Paul George  Forward 27.0 Zion Williamson  Forward 26.0 Jimmy Butler  Forward 25.5 Jayson Tatum  Guard 78.0 James Harden  Guard 71.0 Luka Dončić  Guard 53.5 Russell Westbrook  Guard 44.0 Damian Lillard  Guard 41.5 Trae Young  Guard 38.0 Bradley Beal  Guard 34.5 Donovan Mitchell  Guard 33.0 Kyrie Irving     Random Forest Feature Importance With random forests, we also evaluate the relative importance of each feature in the fitted model. This is done by calculating the relevance score of each feature, standardized such that the sum of all feature scores is 1.\nFrom the Feature Importance plot, we see that Points scored is by and large the most important feature in deciding whether a player is predicted to be All-NBA. This is then followed by Field goals made and then the overall performance of the team. It has been frequently suggested, especially by members of the media who participate in All-NBA voting, that players who put up great numbers on winning teams are viewed more favorably than players who put up amazing numbers on losing teams. This is fuelled by the notion that players on great teams often sacrifice personal accolades for the success of the team, which is warmly embraced by the media.\n\n  Generalized Additive Models (GAM)  Previously, we used a logistic regression model to estimate a player’s probability of being named All-NBA at the end of a season. However, this GLM model assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of All-NBA selection, which may not be true. GAM models on the other hand do not assume a priori any specific structure for the relationship between the predictors and the outcome of All-NBA selection. In fact, GAMs can be used to model non-linear effects of these predictors on the response variable with the aid of spline functions. In a sense, we can consider GAM models as a more flexible version of GLM models. More information on GAMs can be found here.\nWhen fitting the GAM model, we left all hyper-parameters with their default values. A random search on the lambda penalty hyper-parameter was performed, however was found to have weaker performance when applied to the test-set.\nGAM 2020 Predictions  Table 3: Logistic Regression 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 96.6 Anthony Davis  Center 96.0 Rudy Gobert  Center 95.8 Nikola Jokić  Center 29.4 Hassan Whiteside  Center 26.8 Joel Embiid  Forward 100.0 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 100.0 LeBron James  Forward 97.9 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 68.0 Bam Adebayo  Forward 21.5 Jayson Tatum  Forward 18.0 Pascal Siakam  Forward 17.6 Khris Middleton  Forward 8.7 Jimmy Butler  Guard 100.0 James Harden  Guard 99.8 Luka Dončić  Guard 66.8 Kemba Walker  Guard 62.5 Russell Westbrook  Guard 57.7 Kyle Lowry  Guard 18.6 Donovan Mitchell  Guard 15.8 Damian Lillard  Guard 5.8 Zach LaVine      K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)  Before applying the KNN algorithm, we standardized all continuous features in our data. Then, to choose an optimal value of k, we performed the algorithm with varying values of k and looked at the corresponding error rates. As shown in the Error Rate vs. K value graph below, k = 14 corresponded to the value with the lowest error rate.\nKNN 2020 Predictions  Table 4: KNN 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 92.9 Anthony Davis  Center 78.6 Nikola Jokić  Center 50.0 Joel Embiid  Center 28.6 Andre Drummond  Center 28.6 Rudy Gobert  Forward 100.0 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 92.9 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 92.9 LeBron James  Forward 35.7 Jayson Tatum  Forward 28.6 Jimmy Butler  Forward 21.4 Paul George  Forward 14.3 Pascal Siakam  Forward 14.3 Bojan Bogdanović  Guard 92.9 James Harden  Guard 85.7 Luka Dončić  Guard 42.9 Damian Lillard  Guard 42.9 Russell Westbrook  Guard 42.9 Bradley Beal  Guard 28.6 Trae Young  Guard 21.4 Donovan Mitchell  Guard 21.4 Kyle Lowry      Support Vector Machine (SVM)  A random search on the values of the parameters ‘C’ and ‘gamma’ was performed prior to fitting the SVM model, which were found to have similar performance to an SVM model equipped with the default settings of these parameters (C = 1, gamma = 1 / number of features). A radial basis function was chosen for the kernel.\nSVM 2020 Predictions  Table 5: SVM 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 98.7 Anthony Davis  Center 87.5 Rudy Gobert  Center 82.2 Nikola Jokić  Center 52.7 Joel Embiid  Center 50.6 Hassan Whiteside  Forward 100.0 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 100.0 LeBron James  Forward 94.8 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 54.4 Jimmy Butler  Forward 51.2 Khris Middleton  Forward 37.9 Bam Adebayo  Forward 35.7 Jayson Tatum  Forward 28.7 Pascal Siakam  Guard 100.0 James Harden  Guard 99.6 Luka Dončić  Guard 83.4 Damian Lillard  Guard 64.4 Trae Young  Guard 62.8 Russell Westbrook  Guard 33.7 Bradley Beal  Guard 31.3 Ben Simmons  Guard 26.3 Kyle Lowry    \n  XGBoost  XGBoost 2020 Predictions  Table 6: XGBoost 2020 All-NBA predictions  Position Probability Player    Center 89.2 Anthony Davis  Center 64.7 Nikola Jokić  Center 29.2 Rudy Gobert  Center 10.0 Montrezl Harrell  Center 9.1 Joel Embiid  Forward 98.3 Giannis Antetokounmpo  Forward 96.7 LeBron James  Forward 90.6 Kawhi Leonard  Forward 53.3 Khris Middleton  Forward 28.8 Jimmy Butler  Forward 24.4 Pascal Siakam  Forward 22.1 Jayson Tatum  Forward 10.9 Bojan Bogdanović  Guard 90.0 Luka Dončić  Guard 86.2 James Harden  Guard 59.4 Russell Westbrook  Guard 50.1 Donovan Mitchell  Guard 41.3 Kemba Walker  Guard 41.0 Damian Lillard  Guard 38.1 Trae Young  Guard 33.6 Bradley Beal    \n  Appendix All R and Python code to scrape data and fit the models can be found here.\nFeature Variables   PTS: Points scored per 100 possessions AST: Assists per 100 possessions STL: Steals per 100 possessions BLK: Blocks per 100 possessions MP: Minutes played ORB: Offensive rebounds per 100 possessions DRB: Defensive rebounds per 100 possessions TOV: Turnovers per 100 possessions PF: Personal fouls per 100 possessions OFF Rating: Offensive rating (An estimate of points produced per 100 possessions) DEF Rating: Defensive rating (An estimate of points allowed per 100 possessions) Team Performance: A team’s total # wins / League total # wins   How does All-NBA voting work? Selection is controlled by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters (i.e. the media) who select players for the All-NBA 1st, 2nd and 3rd Teams by position. A tally of all the votes are then taken to determine the results of All-NBA selections for all three teams. Players placed on a 1st All-NBA team ballot are awarded 5 points, while players placed on a 2nd All-NBA team ballot are awarded 3 points and 1 point for a 3rd All-NBA team ballot.\n\n Total Votes The total voting results for all players receiving a vote can be found in the table below.\n Table 7: Model Results  Position Player Total Votes    Center Anthony Davis 18  Center Nikola Jokić 9  Center Rudy Gobert 8.5  Center Joel Embiid 3.5  Center Hassan Whiteside 1  Center Montrezl Harrell 1  Center Andre Drummond 0.5  Center Karl-Anthony Towns 0.5  Forward Giannis Antetokounmpo 18  Forward LeBron James 17  Forward Kawhi Leonard 13  Forward Jimmy Butler 7  Forward Khris Middleton 6.5  Forward Jayson Tatum 5  Forward Bam Adebayo 4  Forward Pascal Siakam 3  Forward Paul George 2  Forward Zion Williamson 1.5  Forward Bojan Bogdanović 1  Guard James Harden 18  Guard Luka Dončić 18  Guard Russell Westbrook 10  Guard Damian Lillard 9.5  Guard Trae Young 5.5  Guard Donovan Mitchell 4  Guard Bradley Beal 3.5  Guard Kemba Walker 3  Guard Kyrie Irving 2.5  Guard Kyle Lowry 2  Guard Ben Simmons 1  Guard Chris Paul 0.5  Guard Zach LaVine 0.5    A more in depth breakdown of the votes for each model, can be found in the model’s respective subsection.\n   ","date":1588118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588118400,"objectID":"37871bb734c1ec946d28892c3d03ab65","permalink":"/project/all-nba-predictions/","publishdate":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/all-nba-predictions/","section":"project","summary":"Predicting the All-NBA teams","tags":["Prediction","NBA","Basketball"],"title":"Predicting All-NBA Teams","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Tea"],"categories":["Basketball"],"content":" All-NBA The All-NBA award is an interesting way in which we can keep track of the best stars in the game. Since 1989, 15 players are voted on at the end of each season by reporters and members of the media, to occupy 3 prestigious All-NBA teams; 6 Guards, 6 Forwards and 3 Centers are placed up on the highest pedestals above their peers.\nOutside of being named among the top 15 players, what are the other defining features of an All-NBA player? Is there anything that separates a player on the 1st All-NBA team from a player on the 2nd or 3rd All-NBA teams? Have there been any egregious snubs for this award in the past? To answer these pressing questions, we first turn to Principal Component Analysis for guidance on distinguishing general patterns among All-NBA players.\n Table of contents Principal Component Analysis Data: Per 100 Possessions PCA Visualizations Closing Remarks  Principal Component Analysis  Among many potential capabilities, principal component analysis (PCA) can be used as a simple visualization tool when we have a myriad of continuous features to consider. In our case, we have several recognizable box score metrics like points scored, rebounds and assists that we’ll explore.\nPCA is an unsupervised algorithm that is able to summarize a set of continuous variables into a lower-dimensional representation that is hopefully easier to visualize. In some sense, we are compressing the data into a compact form that captures most of the variability in the data. With PCA, we’ll investigate which combination of features best explain the variability of NBA player performances across different seasons.\n Per 100 Possessions Data  While most box-score metrics are available at the end of each season on a per game basis (ex: Points per game), using a per game standard makes it challenging to compare performances of players under different team styles of basketball. For example, recently we’ve seen an emphasis on an up-tempo and spread out offence largely popularized by coach Mike D’Antoni. The modern NBA offence has seen an explosion in the volume of shots taken each game, especially beyond the arc. Pace of play is also much faster now than what it was even 10 years ago, which makes it exceedingly difficult to also compare players from different eras.\nOne standard that might allow a better comparison of players under different offence styles and eras is the per 100 possessions metric. This metric standardizes each player’s opportunity to fill the stat sheet, by exactly measuring how well players perform per 100 possessions rather than by per game. Here, players who stuff the stat sheet with fewer opportunities will now appear more favourable than players who conversely had more opportunities to fill the same stat sheet.\nWe obtain per 100 possessions data through Basketball Reference, with the help of the bball R package.\n Data Preparation Since the inception of 3 distinct All-NBA teams started in 1989, we begin collecting data from 1989 until the past 2019 season.\nTo remove as much noise and outliers as possible, we’ve decided to only include players that satisfy the following two conditions:\nPlayed in at least 10 games Averaged at least 15 minutes played per game  Applying the above two filters reduces the size of the data from 13760 to 8729 observations. Additionally, we chose to look at a total of 25 continuous features.\n PCA Visualizations  After standardizing each feature to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, we then apply the PCA algorithm through the Scikit-learn library in Python. We will first focus on visualization across the first 2 principal components, as it is easier to represent data in 2 dimensions.\nEach principal component is simply a normalized linear combination of the 25 features, found by maximizing a variance objective function. Subsequent principal components are found with the added constraint that they are orthogonal to the previous principal components. Loadings are the weights for each of the 25 features relative to a principal component.\n Loadings Plot With a PC Loadings plot of the first and second principal components, we can depict the directions in feature space along which the data vary the most. Each loadings vector shows the relative importance/weight that both principal components place on the 25 features.\nFrom this loadings plot, we see that Principal Component 1 (PC1) places its highest weights on rebounds, blocks, and field goal percentages (i.e. highest loading values along the x-axis). Hence, players with high PC1 scores roughly correspond to players who can crash and bang in the paint to secure rebounds, alter shots and perhaps have nice efficiency in finishing buckets near the rim. Interestingly, features with highly negative weights along this principal component include 3 pointers made and attempted, steals and assists. These metrics seem to summarize traits among traditional Guards (i.e. perimeter players).\nSimilarly, we see that Principal Component 2 (PC2) places its highest weights on points, field goals, field goal attempts and free throws made (i.e. highest values along the y-axis). We shouldn’t be too surprised to see all four of these variables located closely to one another since they are all somewhat correlated. Eventually as players take more and more shots, this will increase the number of field goals made which in turn will increase the number of points scored for that player. Players with high PC2 scores might correspond to players vying for scoring titles.\n PC Scores Plot How do players, and more importantly All-NBA players, fit along this 2-D representation? For each of the n=8729 observations, we plot the scores of the first principal component along the x-axis, and the scores of the second principal component along the y-axis.\nLet’s first take a look at the scores for guards.\nHere we see a clear distinction of players who make All-NBA compared to those who don’t. While the majority of guards tend to have negative scores along the PC1 axis, about half of the All-NBA guards have highly positive PC1 scores. This might indicate that having higher versatility, that is the ability to not only facilitate plays but also score and grab rebounds, might lead to an All-NBA player. Of course, we do see a sizeable amount of guards placed near the direction favouring steals and assists. This would indicate that having higher versatility is certainly not a prerequisite for a guard to be All-NBA. Surprisingly, there does not appear to be an obvious pattern of players on 1st team All-NBA compared to the 2nd and 3rd teams.\nMoving onto Forwards, we see that most forwards seem to fit anywhere on this plot. However, majority Forwards who end up making All-NBA are found in the upper right quadrant with high PC1 and PC2 scores. In fact, it seems like having higher scores on both these axes is related to Forwards on the 1st All-NBA team. We see a bit more disparity of the 3 All-NBA teams on this plot.\nLastly for centers we see that they are placed mostly on the right side of this score plot. This is intuitive since most centers are not adept in steals, assists or 3 pointers. Furthermore, centers tend to grab more rebounds and block more shots, so it is not a surprise to see their scores be far along the right of the x-axis. Interestingly, many All-NBA centers have positive PC2 scores, especially centers who make the 1st All-NBA team (except for 2 occasions). This might indicate that centers who can not only peform a traditional center role, but also contribute offensively at an elite level tend to make the 1st All-NBA team.\n How about the 2020 season? How would players in the 2020 season fare on this PC plot? Here, we plot all scores of players in the 2020 NBA season. Since it is difficult to compactly label all these points, we chose to label only the starters in the 2020 All-Star Game.\nHere we see some interesting points. Trae Young so clearly separates himself with an anomalously high PC2 score which complements his surreal performance in running the Hawks offence with a bevy of scoring and facilitating opportunities. On the complete other side of the spectrum, we see Giannis with a huge PC1 score which is a tribute to his dominant ability to grab boards, alter shots and score at will in the paint. Lastly, we note that Lebron is lagging a bit behind both Kawhi and Luka on both PC scores.\n Scree Plot So far, we’ve only considered a two-dimensional representation of the 25-dimensional data for simplicity. However, does 2 dimensions successfully capture the major patterns in the data? How much information is lost by projecting the observations onto only the first two principal components? That is, how much of the variance in the data is not contained in the first two principal components? To answer these important questions, we present a scree plot which depicts the proportion of variance explained by each of the principal components.\nWe see that the first principal component explains about 28% of the variance in the data, and the second principal component explains 24% of the variance. Together, the first two principal components explain almost 52% of the variance in the data; just over half of the entire variance. The third principal component accounts for under 10% of the variance, while the remaining principal components each slightly hover above or are below 5% of the total variance.\nWhile the first two dimensions does miss out on a sizeable amount of variance, it does still provide an okay summary of the data. The convenience of plotting in only two dimensions is of course why we focussed merely on 2 principal components. The 3rd principal component explains less than half of either of the first two principal components, so it was not worthwhile to pursue an added layer of dimensionality with so little upside.\n Closing Remarks  So, what have we learned from looking at these plots? Essentially, Forwards and Centers who get more rebounds, blocks, points and field goal makes are more likely to be All-NBA caliber players. Furthermore, extra versatility for guards might make them All-NBA bound, but guards that excel under a traditional guard role can still vie for the All-NBA. In other words, the Earth is round, rain is wet and Kawhi is still on load management. While we aren’t making new and deep impressions on the game of basketball it is still interesting to visualize specifically the tendencies of All-NBA players.\n Appendix Biplots combine both loading and score plots in a single display. They might be easier to analyse since everything is on a single plot, but I find them to be a bit clunky especially with many features plotted. To visualize relationships between continuous features, it might be appealing to look at pairwise correlation plots. The issue though is that with many continuous features included, these plots can get overloaded and difficult to visualize. In this project we only had 25 features to consider, which isn’t too bad.\n  ","date":1587427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587427200,"objectID":"2477d8603f55269dde78dc3a36f5ec3c","permalink":"/project/all-nba-pca/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/all-nba-pca/","section":"project","summary":"NBA Data Visualization","tags":["Data Visualization","NBA","Basketball"],"title":"Principal Component Analysis on All-NBA","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Tea"],"categories":["Tennis"],"content":"  Attribution: Special thanks to Jeff Sackmann for scraping and providing the data freely on his Github page.   How do 1st serves differ from 2nd serves? Tennis serve faults are a common occurrence in any competitive tennis match. Depending on whether a player is on their 1st or their 2nd serve, serving strategy is at the forefront of the player’s decision making process in terms of how they want to attack their opponent. For instance, a player might choose a powerful serve that reduces the returner’s reaction time and ultimately makes these serves more difficult for the opponent to return. However, these fast serves are difficult to hit accurately and have a higher likelihood of landing outside the service box, usually resulting in a service fault. Instead, a player might choose a slower serve, which are easier for the player to hit accurately and consistently. However, these slow serves allow a higher reaction time for the returner, and may also be more predictable and easier for the opposing player returning the serve.\nMoreover on 1st serve, the player is reassured that if they miss their 1st serve, they will still have a second opportunity to serve again without penalty. Hence, the risk-return tradeoff of attacking the opponent with a big and powerful serve is certainly manageable. However, if the player is instead on 2nd serve then they may be more wary of this tradeoff, as there are no more remaining serves in the particular game. The choice of a more powerful but inconsistent serve vs. a slower but consistent serve is paramount as the player approaches the service line.\nIn this project, we look closely into the service power-consistency tradeoff with a couple of data visualizations.\nWe will first present an exploratory analysis on serves from some familiar names from both the ATP and WTA worlds. From the ATP, we chose to look at Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. From the WTA, we chose to look at Serena Williams, Simona Halep and Bianca Andreescu. After some data cleaning and aggregating steps on match summary data found on Jeff Sackmann’s Github page, we produce the following analysis from Wimbledon and the US Open grand slam tournaments of 2019.\nObserved 1st Serve Speed vs. 2nd Serve Speed at the 2019 Wimbledon Tournament As an exploratory step, we first plot the observed distributions of 1st serve speeds compared to 2nd serve speeds during the 2019 Wimbledon tournament. Since tennis serves are unique for each individual player, we provide plots of tennis serve speeds for each player of interest. On the x-axis, we have the serve speed in kilometres per hour, and on the y-axis we have the observed density (i.e. the proportion of each observed serve speed). For each plot, the distribution of 1st serve speeds are plotted in green while the distribution of 2nd serve speeds are plotted in orange. On the plots, we also present the average 1st serve and 2nd serve speeds with vertical dashed lines.\nATP Wimbledon 2019 Serve Speeds Starting with the ATP players, we present the following serve speed distribution plots:\nNote: From the dataset, both Novak and Roger played 7 matches while Rafa played 6 matches (Federer defeated Nadal in the semifinals, before falling to Djokovic in the finals).\nFrom the above 3 graphics, we make some simple remarks:\n For all 3 ATP players, the 1st serve distribution is left skewed, while the 2nd serve speed distribution appears more symmetric. The 1st serve skewed distribution indicates that on 1st serve, these 3 ATP players frequently serve at faster speeds than their average serve speed.\n The average 1st serve speed is consistently greater than the average 2nd serve speed.\n With the exception of Novak Djokovic, the maximum 2nd serve speed is lower than the average 1st serve speed! Djokovic’s 2nd serve speed has greater variance when compared to Roger and Rafa. Perhaps this has to do with Djokovic’s strategy of being more unpredictable in his 2nd serves?\n In any case, these 3 graphics indicate that these 3 ATP players tend to switch up their serve approaches given the situation of the match: On 1st serve, these players serve powerfully, but on 2nd serve these players serve more conservatively.\n  Moving on to the women’s game, we observe similar patterns when we look at the 2 WTA players who reached the Wimbledon final (Halep defeated Williams).\n WTA Wimbledon 2019 Serve Speeds Note: From the dataset, both Williams and Halep played 7 matches. Halep defeated Williams in the finals.\nThroughout the Wimbledon tournament, both Williams and Halep display distinct serve speeds depending on whether they are on their 1st or 2nd serve. The results are similar to what we’ve seen on the ATP serve graphics, however the first serve speed distributions here do not appear to be as left skewed as we’ve previously seen on the ATP graphics.\n What are some possible implications of a slower 2nd serve speed? Other than the speed of the serve, what else differs when players are serving on 1st serve, compared to when they serve on 2nd serve? We compile some summary statistics that compares the average serve speed, as well as the average win percentage, rally length and distance run by players when they are on 1st serve compared to when they are on 2nd serve.\nMore specifically, we calculate the following:\n Δ Serve Speed (KM/H) = Average 2nd serve speed - Average 1st serve speed Δ Win percentage = % Points won on 2nd serve - % Points won on 1st serve Δ Rally Length = Average rally length on 2nd serve - Average rally length on 1st serve Δ Distance Run = Average distance run on 2nd serve - Average distance run on 1st serve     Player Matches Δ Serve Speed (KM/H) Δ Win percentage Δ Rally Length Δ Distance Run    Djokovic 7 🔻29 🔻19 ❇️ 2.0 ❇️ 6.0  Nadal 6 🔻29 🔻16 ❇️ 1.0 ❇️ 3.0  Federer 7 🔻29 🔻15 ❇️ 1.5 ❇️ 4.0  Williams 7 🔻24 🔻14 ❇️ 1.0 ❇️ 3.0  Halep 7 🔻28 🔻10 ▶️ 0.0 ▶️ 0.0    From the above table, we can generate some interesting ideas about serve speeds. When we compare 2nd serves to 1st serves:\n Serve speed decreases Win percentage decreases Rally length increases Distance Run increases  How are all of these variables related to one another? We know that serve speed decreases as players go from their 1st serve to their 2nd serve. Furthermore, players tend to win a lower proportion of games as they play on their 2nd serves. Not only that but, the rallies that players are involved in are usually longer requiring more distance to run as players play on their 2nd serve.\nAs players use a more consistent 2nd serve approach, their serve speed drops which makes the serve easier to return. The opposing player can now anticipate and return the serve, get into a groove more easily, and force the game into longer rallies. More rallies require the player to move more around the court and chase the ball which explains the increase in distance run.\n  US Open 2019 Serve Speeds Inspired by these observed these patterns at Wimbledon, we then explore whether they exist in other tournaments where players play on different surfaces (Wimbledon is played on grass courts). To provide a partial answer to this question, we perform the same analysis using data from the 2019 US Open tournament, which is played on hardcourt.\nATP US Open 2019 Serve Speeds ```{r, USO9_us.png)\nFrom the 3 graphics above, we see that the 3 ATP players at the US Open all exhibit similar patterns observed during the Wimbledon grand slam tournament.\n WTA US Open 2019 Serve Speeds For completeness, we present the same table of numbers for the 2019 US Open tournament.\n  Player Δ Serve Speed (KM/H) Δ Win percentage Δ Rally Length Δ Distance Run     Djokovic 🔻33 🔻13 ❇️ 2.0 ❇️ 5.0   Nadal 🔻34 🔻18 ❇️ 3.0 ❇️ 9.0   Federer 🔻33 🔻22 ❇️ 2.0 ❇️ 5.0   Williams 🔻30 🔻17 ❇️ 1.0 ❇️ 4.0   Andreescu 🔻21 🔻18 ❇️ 1.0 ❇️ 3.0      Evaluating consistency of 1st serves \u0026amp; 2nd serves We’ve seen that 1st serves tend to be faster than 2nd serves, and players also tend to win more service games on 1st serves than on 2nd serves. You can imagine that if players serve as powerfully as they do on 1st serve throughout the entire match, perhaps they could win more service games. Unfortunately, the rate of success for hitting the powerful 1st serve is much lower than the rate of success for hitting the less powerful 2nd serve. We support this idea by presenting the percentages of serves that fall in the service box (i.e. serves that don’t miss) for 1st serves compared to 2nd serves. We present these percentages below for 5 players obtained from the 2019 Wimbledon tournament.\n  Player % 1st serve in % 2nd serve in       Djokovic 75 88     Nadal 73 93     Federer 75 94     Williams 73 92     Halep 76 91       For these players, 1st serves consistently have a lower percentage of landing inside the service box than 2nd serves. This may be because players have a higher margin of error on 1st serve, and can afford to swing powerfully. However, on 2nd serve the margin of error is lower since a missed serve here would now result in a double fault (meaning the opponent wins the point).\nPowerful serves are more likely to land out, which is why players tend to instead proceed with a more conservative, but more consistent 2nd serve approach.\n  Further Analysis It would be interesting to see if we can somehow model the serve power vs. consistency tradeoff. In particular, we want to know: “Over the long run, which is the better strategy: Serving powerfully or serving consistently?” If players approached 2nd serves the same way as they do 1st serves where they serve as powerfully as they can, would this be a better strategy than a conservative 2nd serve approach? Or is the risk from this approach too high? Over the long run, how many games would a player expect to win if they were to use this approach?\nIn this report, we’ve only looked at unique tennis players at the top of the tennis world. Could we make some conclusions about all tennis players in general?\nOne simlple analysis we’ve done on combined data from all players participating in the 2019 Wimbledon tournament, is verifying that service win percentage differs between 1st serve and 2nd serve. We first present a contingency table with the number of service games won stratified across the serve number:\n ServeNumber Win 1 2 No 8896 6769 Yes 20490 8567 Then, using a chi-square test, we obtain a p-value less than 0.05. We conclude that there exists some relationship between win percentage and the serve number. Players on 1st serve are more likely to win, compared to when players are on their 2nd serve.\n  ","date":1585180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585180800,"objectID":"d80bf280dc637cd55b7be4425115fc85","permalink":"/post/2019-serve-speeds/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-serve-speeds/","section":"post","summary":"Tennis Exploratory Data Analysis","tags":["Grand-Slam","Serve","Serve speed","Tennis"],"title":"Serve Power vs. Consistency Tradeoff","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peter Tea"],"categories":["Basketball"],"content":" 2020 MIT SSAC For the 2020 MIT SSAC Hackathon, participants were given access to tracking data for 8 NCAA basketball games. My group and I decided to look into how shot release angles, shot release velocities and shot distance from the hoop affect the probability of a player making a shot. While we did run out of time, the ultimate goal was then to observe how player fatigue impact these variables (eg: how does shot release angle and velocity change when players are tired - and how much could this impact the probability that players make shots?).\nHere is a link to the slides used for our presentation!\n ","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584316800,"objectID":"71d5456af5fa4024c8dc01628188119b","permalink":"/project/ssac_2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ssac_2020/","section":"project","summary":"SSAC","tags":["Tracking Data","Basketball"],"title":"2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Hackathon","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Tea"],"categories":["Tennis"],"content":"       2019 Serving Efficiency at Grand Slams  Attribution: Special thanks to Jeff Sackmann for scraping and providing the data freely on his Github page.   Recapping the 2019 Grand Slam season With the conclusion of the 2019 Tennis season, the Big 3 (Nadal, Djokovic and Federer) all continued their domination during the largest stages of the season: the grand slam tournaments\nRafa Nadal cruised to the Roland Garros chip winning the final match in four sets against Thiem, while also capturing the US Open championship in a 5-set thriller over Medvedev.\nMeanwhile, Novak Djokovic successfully defended his Wimbledon trophy against Roger Federer in a heavy-weight 5-set match, while also capturing the Australian Open chip against Nadal.\nFinally, while Roger Federer did not win any grand slams in this 2019 season, he did reach the Wimbledon final as well as make some exciting runs at the other 3 grand slam tournaments. Not bad for the 38-year old Swiss!\n How well did the Big 3 defend and break serves? To analyse at a granular level how well the Big 3 performed during the 2019 grand slam tournaments, we look at their performances in defending their own service games and in attacking their opponent service games. A player who effectively defends their serve should win a high proportion of the games in which they serve first. Furthermore, a player who successfully attacks their opponents’ serve should win a reasonable amount of break points against their opponent’s serve.\nTo measure a players defensive and offensive ability, we look at the total number of service games defended, and the total number of opponents serves broken respectively. Moreover, to account for opportunity, we divide these metrics by the total number of player service games and opponent service games respectively.\n Proportion of service games defended = # of service games won / Total # player of service games\n Proportion of opponent service games broken = # of service games broken / Total # of opponent service games\n   What do the numbers say? After some data cleaning and aggregating steps on match summary data found on Jeff Sackmann’s Github page, we produce the following table that combines the results from all 4 grand slam tournaments from the 2019 season.\n Table 1: Grand Slam data  Player_Name Matches_Won SvGmsW_Prop BPW_Prop    Rafael Nadal 25 91.5 36.3  Novak Djokovic 22 88.6 36.4  Roger Federer 18 91.2 26.4  Kei Nishikori 14 80.2 29.5  David Goffin 11 79.2 30.5  Daniil Medvedev 11 82.3 26.7  Roberto Bautista Agut 11 86.5 25.8  Alexander Zverev 10 78.3 25.4  Stan Wawrinka 10 89.8 18.5  Grigor Dimitrov 10 85.5 22.9    During the grand slams Nadal, Djokovic and Federer are ranked 1, 2 and 3 respectively in terms of matches won. The other two columns we calculated represent the proportion of service games defended (SvGmsW_Prop), and the proportion of opponent serves broken (BPW_Prop).\n Comparing the big 3 to other ATP players via Bubble plots Using the two metrics (proportion of service games defended, and the proportion of opponent serves broken) we mapped out the defensive and offensive prowess of the Big 3 compared to the abilities of the other ATP players in the graphic below. We placed these two metrics on the x- and y-axis respectively. Additionally, to represent the success of the ATP players, we added an extra dimension that represents number of matches won by each player. The larger the bubble is, the more grand slam matches a player has won.\nFrom the above bubble plot, we make some very intuitive remarks.\nLarger bubbles are found on the top right corner of the plot. This indicates that players who are good at both defending their serve and at breaking their opponent serve tend to win more tennis matches. Unsurprisingly, since the Big 3 are good at both, their bubbles are found in the top right corner.\n ATP players tend to be better at holding serve than they are at breaking their opponent’s serve. Many of the top players hold serve at a rate of 80%, while most players are unable to break their opponent at a rate of 25%.\n ATP players that are very good at holding serve, but are average at breaking serve still tend to win a sizeable amount of matches. Conversely, players that do not defend their serve well, but who excel at breaking their opponent tend to not win many matches.\n  For those who like interactive plots as much as I do, I’ve produced the same plot using the R package gplotly.\n

Country Strength in Tennis On the ATP side of tennis, the growth of Canadian representation at major tournaments has really taken off recently. By the end of the 2019 season Denis Shapovalov (age 20) ranked 15th, Felix Auger-Aliassime (age 19) ranked 21st and Milos Raonic (age 28) ranked 31st. Compared to a decade prior, it\u0026rsquo;d be common to not see a single Canadian ranked in the top 100 in terms of singles play. The same can be said on the WTA side of tennis, where Canadian Bianca Andreescu (age 19) ranked 5th by the end of the 2019 season, and also brought home Canada\u0026rsquo;s first grand slam champion (US Open). A decade prior, many of the top Canadian tennis players were not recognizable among the world\u0026rsquo;s elite. So how far exactly have we come as a nation competing in Tennis? With some choropleth maps, we help answer this question!\nHow do we measure country strength in Tennis? We look directly at ranking points. Ranking points are awarded to players who win at big stages of the tennis season. In terms of tournaments, A tennis season can be broken down into Grand Slams, Masters 1000 and Masters 500/250s. The further along a player progresses through a tennis tournament, the more ranking points that player is awarded. For example, a player who wins a grand slam tournament is awarded 2000 points while the runner up is awarded 1200 ranking points. A player who wins a Master 1000 tournament is awarded 1000 points, while the runner up is awarded 600 ranking points.\nFor each player, the final ranking points of the season is computed as follows:\nPlayer scores for all 4 grand slam tournaments + Player score for all 8 Masters 1000 + Player\u0026rsquo;s best 6 results from Master\u0026rsquo;s 500\u0026frasl;250 tournaments. For each season, we quantify each country\u0026rsquo;s tennis strength by computing the total ranking points from players originating from the same country divided by the grand total ranking points of the season.\nUsing player ranking data from Oncourt, I\u0026rsquo;ve processed the data to summarize the total relative contributing ranking points from each country. This is done by summing the yearly ranking points for players from each country, and then dividing by the total ranking points distributed for that year.\nATP Analysis Here is a static image from the 2019 season:\nThe interactive version of this map shows exactly how the nation strength of tennis has shifted through time.\nFrom 2003 – 2019, the ATP world has largely been dominated by Spain and USA.
