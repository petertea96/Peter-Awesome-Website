<h3>All-NBA Selection <a name="introduction"></a></h3>
<p>The All-NBA award is an annual NBA distinction bestowed upon players with outstanding performances for a given season. Since 1989, the All-NBA award is partitioned into 3 tiers;
1st, 2nd and 3rd All-NBA where each team is uniquely composed of 2 guards, 2 forwards and 1 center. In total, 6 guards, 6 forwards and 3 centers are selected for this prestigious award. Not only is there a financial incentive for players implicated with selection into the All-NBA, but there is also a reputation reward which in some way validates these chosen players as the true stars in the game.</p>
<p>The NBA holds a firm reputation of being a <code>Star-Driven League</code>, meaning that teams exclusively boasting the greatest players are the ones who can legitimately compete for championships. Using the All-NBA tag as a proxy for <code>great players</code> provides an interesting avenue where we could identify foundational pieces that may eventually land a championship. In this project, we build classification models to predict which players will form all 3 All-NBA teams.</p>

<h2>Obtaining/Scraping NBA Data <a name="data"></a></h2>
<p>Box-score metrics standardized by <em>per 100 possessions</em> was obtained through R, using the <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/bobbyingram/bballR/man/scrape_all_players.html">bballR R package</a>.
We chose to look at per 100 possessions as it provides a more intuitive comparison between players under different eras and team offence styles.</p>
<p>Past All-NBA winners was scraped through <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball Reference</a> with the <code>rVest</code> R package.</p>
<p>To further reduce noise in the data, we chose to only consider players meeting the following 2 conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Player participated in at least 10 games</li>
<li>Player played at least 25 minutes/game</li>
</ol>

<div id="how-does-all-nba-voting-work" class="section level3">
<h3>How does All-NBA voting work?</h3>
<p>Selection is controlled by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters (i.e. the media) who select players for the All-NBA 1st, 2nd and 3rd Teams by position. A tally of all the votes are then taken to determine the results of All-NBA selections for all three teams. Players placed on a 1st All-NBA team ballot are awarded 5 points, while players placed on a 2nd All-NBA team ballot are awarded 3 points and 1 point for a 3rd All-NBA team ballot.</p>
