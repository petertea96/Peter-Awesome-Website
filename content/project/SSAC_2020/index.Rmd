## 2020 MIT SSAC

For the 2020 MIT SSAC Hackathon, participants were given access to tracking data for 8 NCAA basketball games. My group and I decided to look into how shot release angles, shot release velocities and shot distance from the hoop affect the probability of a player making a shot. While we did run out of time, the ultimate goal was then to observe how player fatigue impact these variables (eg: how does shot release angle and velocity change when players are tired - and how much could this impact the probability that players make shots?).
