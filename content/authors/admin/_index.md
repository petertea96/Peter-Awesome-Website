Welcome to this awesome website! This is where I will be posting some fun data projects. Please stay tuned for things to come...

I am currently completing my Master's degree under the supervision of [Tim Swartz](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~tim/) with a [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadaâ€™s](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) (NSERC) Graduate Scholarship. I work as an R facilitator at the [Research Commons](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc) of SFU, providing R code consultations to graduate students for their research projects, as well as running R workshops. 

In the past, I've been fortunate to hold positions as a Statistical Genetics researcher under the supervision of [Kelly Burkett](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/kburkett/), as well as a Data Scientist at the [Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html).
