I **completed** a Master's degree in Statistics at SFU, supervised by the legendary [Tim Swartz](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~tim/)! You can find my recent tennis analytic blogs and data visualizations hosted on [StatsOnTheT](http://on-the-t.com/):


* [Spatial Exploration Serves](http://on-the-t.com/2021/05/02/Spatial-Exploration-Serves/) (May 2021)

> Hawkeye tracking data is now publicly available! In this post, we dive into player-specific service patterns with spatio-temporal data and intuitive shot heatmaps. We find that players overtly target the returner's `backhand` on second serve, and that `Roger Federer` has predictable serve patterns on high pressure points.

* [Sizing Up the Height Advantage on Serve](http://on-the-t.com/2020/10/25/sizing-up-height-advantage/) (Oct 2020)

> How much does height influence a player's ability to hit aces? And does the added reach also convey an advantage on the return game? Here, we model `Ace Hit Rates` with player height using polynomial regression. The metric `Aces allowed rate` is also introduced and compared between players!

* [Serve Chronicles](http://on-the-t.com/2020/08/10/serve-chronicles/) (Aug 2020)

> The serve is arguably the most important shot in tennis, and there have been some *conspicuous* serve performances in recent memory! Eg: Guillermo Coria once averaged 4 double faults per 10 second serves in 2006. In this post, we look at outlying performances and trends in aces/double faults. Interestingly, WTA players on average hit more double faults than they do aces.

* [When Two First Serves are Better Than One: Part 1](http://on-the-t.com/2020/06/17/when-two-first-serves-1/); [Part 2](http://on-the-t.com/2020/06/27/when-two-first-serves-2/) (Jun 2020)

> In 2019, Sascha Zverev’s second serve was a major liability in his game. Would Zverev been better off hitting two `flat` serves rather than the conventional `flat-kick` serve combo? 

Outside academia , I've interned at [Aquatic Informatics](https://aquaticinformatics.com/) and at the [Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html). In academia, I've been an R consultant at SFU [Research Commons](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc), and a Statistical Genetics researcher with [Kelly Burkett](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/kburkett/).
