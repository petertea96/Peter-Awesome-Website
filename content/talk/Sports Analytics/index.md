I was a research poster presenter at the 2018 Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Healthcare ([CUCOH](https://www.cucoh.com)) - "The Future of Healthcare: A Multidisciplinary Approach". Here is a [link to my poster](Peter_Poster.pdf), which was presented to a group of Queen's medical students as well as undergraduate science students across Canada. I unfortunately did not win the poster research competition (some musician won), but had a blast presenting and hearing about other research topics! I've also presented this topic in a lab meeting, using [these prepared slides](Peter_Presentation.pdf)
